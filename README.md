The Portable Document Format (PDF) is widely recognized for its platform independence and feature richness, which, unfortunately, also makes it a prime target for malware dissemination. With the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, traditional antivirus solutions are often inadequate, necessitating more dynamic approaches. This research paper explores the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the automated detection and classification of malicious versus benign PDF files. By leveraging a variety of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and analyzing a comprehensive set of features extracted from PDFs, this study aims to identify and quantify the key indicators of malignancy in PDF files.
